            <p>I am currently pursing my dreams of becoming a <em>graphic designer</em>. I am passionate about spreading creativity and inclusivity with my designs. I have always strived to learn new skills and keep up with new design trends, to help push me forwards in my career. I have an interest in motion graphics,<abbr title="web development">web dev</abbr>and <abbr title="user interface and user experience">ui/ux</abbr>. </p>
